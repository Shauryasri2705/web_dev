    <h1 style="background-color: rgb(164, 152, 204);">1. Definition of Success</h1>
   Success is the achievement of a goal or the attainment of personal fulfillment. It varies from person to person—it could mean career advancement, financial freedom, good relationships, or inner peace.
   <h2 style="background-color: rgb(158, 174, 189);">2. Personal vs. Societal Success</h2>
Some measure success by societal standards—wealth, status, or fame. Others see it as personal growth, happiness, or staying true to their values. Real success often comes from balancing both.
<h2 style="background-color: rgb(135, 136, 80);">3. Goals and Vision</h2>
Success begins with setting clear goals. Knowing what you want and having a vision helps guide actions and decisions, turning dreams into achievable targets.
<h2 style="background-color: burlywood;">4. Hard Work and Discipline</h2>
No success comes without effort. Consistent hard work, focus, and self-discipline are essential. It's not just about talent—it's about showing up, learning, and pushing through challenges.
<h2 style="background-color: cadetblue;">5. Overcoming Failure</h2>
Success often includes setbacks. Resilience—the ability to recover and learn from failure—is a key ingredient. Each failure is a step toward growth and improvement.
<h2 style="background-color: palegoldenrod;">6. Satisfaction and Impact</h2>
True success brings a sense of fulfillment and often includes making a positive impact on others. It's about living meaningfully, contributing to society, and being proud of the journey.
